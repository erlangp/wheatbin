[![WHEATBIN's logo][logo-wb]][Wheatbin]


Wheatbin is Project Management Software that combines Kanban with the **[Law of the Harvest]** philosophy. Wheatbin helps you sow, grow and harvest all your hard work.

[Wheatbin] is a software fork of [Kanboard] v1.0.22 by supercoder Frédéric Guillot (see the [diff]). It's a <strong>major overhaul of the UX/IU</strong> with mobile devices being the first consideration in the redesign. 

[![WHEATBIN's task screen][task-wb]][Wheatbin]

And as with Kanboard, Wheatbin includes:

- Multiple boards with the ability to drag and drop tasks
- Open source and self-hosted
- Super simple installation
- Distributed under [MIT License](LICENSE)

To get started with Wheatbin, see the **installation [instructions]**. 

For more information on the Law of the Harvest philosophy, **The Seven Laws of the Harvest: God’s Proven Plan for Abundant Life** can be purchased at **[Amazon.com][book]**. It is not an instruction manual for Wheatbin software.
